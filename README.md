A C# application allows the user to load an image, perform edge detection using the Prewitt algorithm with options to select the number of threads and the implementation library (C++ or Assembly), display the results, save them to a file, and view the processing time for the selected library. Procedure in assembly is written with usage of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) technology to archieve efficeint parallel processing of data. Implementation utilizes vectorized instructions such as MOVQ, PMOVZXBW PSUBW, PADDW, PACKUSWB, wchich are part of SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) or AVC (Advanced Vector Extensions) instruction sets.
